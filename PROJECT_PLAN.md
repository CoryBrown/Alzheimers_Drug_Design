# Alzheimer's siRNA Drug Design Project Plan
**Duration:** November 1st, 2023 - January 31st, 2024

## Phase 1: Platform Foundation and Initial Setup
**Duration:** November 1 - November 30  
**Objective:** Establish foundational components and complete initial setup; begin early deployment to AWS.  
**Completed:**
- Initial project planning.
- Dockerized PostgreSQL for local development and testing.
- Dockerized minimal React frontend.
**Tasks:**
- Source Alzheimer's datasets relevant to siRNA therapy for PostgreSQL integration.
- Set up and configure AWS RDS for PostgreSQL to manage Alzheimer's datasets.
- Develop the basic structure of the FastAPI backend.
- Set up basic CI/CD pipeline for early deployment of Docker containers to AWS.

## Phase 2: Data Integration and Backend Enhancement
**Duration:** December 1 - December 20  
**Objective:** Integrate datasets into the platform, enhance backend functionalities, and continue AWS deployment.  
**Tasks:**
- Integrate Alzheimer's datasets into both local PostgreSQL and AWS RDS.
- Further develop and Dockerize the FastAPI backend for interactions with AWS RDS and local PostgreSQL.
- Begin developing basic data visualization components in the React frontend.
- Continuously deploy updates to AWS to test data integration and backend enhancements.

## Phase 3: Advanced Backend and Frontend Development
**Duration:** December 21 - January 10  
**Objective:** Develop advanced backend functionalities, enhance frontend visualization, and refine AWS deployment.  
**Tasks:**
- Finalize the integration of siRNA-related Alzheimer's datasets.
- Enhance FastAPI backend with functionalities for in-depth siRNA data analysis.
- Implement and refine advanced visualization components in React frontend.
- Regularly deploy backend and frontend updates to AWS for iterative testing and refinement.

## Phase 4: Machine Learning Development and Simulations
**Duration:** January 11 - January 25  
**Objective:** Develop machine learning models and conduct molecular dynamics simulations; deploy updates to AWS.  
**Tasks:**
- Develop and integrate PyTorch machine learning models for RNA sequencing data analysis.
- Conduct molecular dynamics simulations using OpenMM, focusing on siRNA interactions in Alzheimer's.
- Continuously deploy machine learning and simulation updates to AWS for testing and validation.

## Phase 5: Final Integration, Optimization, and Deployment
**Duration:** January 26 - January 31  
**Objective:** Integrate advanced analytics into the platform, finalize for deployment on AWS.  
**Tasks:**
- Integrate findings from PyTorch and OpenMM into the frontend.
- Conduct final optimizations and testing of the entire platform.
- Document the development process, focusing on integration and deployment strategies.
- Finalize the deployment strategy for AWS, ensuring smooth operation on AWS RDS and ECS.

## Vacation Break
**Duration:** November 18 - November 28

## Budget Allocation
- **AWS services (RDS, ECS, etc.):** $120
- **Software development tools and miscellaneous expenses (domains, SSL certificates, etc.):** $80
- **Total Budget:** $200
