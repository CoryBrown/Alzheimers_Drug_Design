# Alzheimers_Drug_Design

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform data analysis on molecular data, particularly focusing on SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) data. The project incorporates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Genetic Algorithms for feature extraction and molecule optimization. It also includes a web application for data visualization and interaction.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

- `POSTGRES_USER`: Username for the PostgreSQL database. No default value.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password for the PostgreSQL database. No default value.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Name of the PostgreSQL database. Default is `mydatabase`.

Refer to `.env.sample` for a template.

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the project locally will be added as the project progresses.
